# Breast Cancer Classification Using Neural Networks

This notebook demonstrates how to build a neural network model to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The workflow includes:

- Importing and exploring the dataset
- Data preprocessing and standardization
- Building and training a neural network with TensorFlow and Keras
- Evaluating model performance
- Visualizing training progress
- Making predictions with the trained model

This project provides a practical example of applying machine learning techniques to a real-world medical dataset for binary classification tasks.
