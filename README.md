# Breast Cancer Classification Using Neural Networks

This notebook demonstrates how to build a neural network model to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The workflow includes:

- Importing and exploring the dataset
- Data preprocessing and standardization
- Building and training a neural network with TensorFlow and Keras
- Evaluating model performance
- Visualizing training progress
- Making predictions with the trained model

This project provides a practical example of applying machine learning techniques to a real-world medical dataset for binary classification tasks.

### Model Training Report

The neural network was trained for 10 epochs. The training accuracy improved steadily from 48% to 97%, while the validation accuracy quickly reached 95% and remained stable. The loss values for both training and validation sets decreased consistently, indicating effective learning and no signs of overfitting.

**Final Epoch Results:**
- Training Accuracy: 97.6%
- Training Loss: 0.0825
- Validation Accuracy: 95.7%
- Validation Loss: 0.0913

The model demonstrates strong performance and generalization on the validation set.
